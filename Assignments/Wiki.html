    <strong>Terence Kelcey Priester II</strong> (born September 25, 1996) I'm gonna be completely honest, there's not much to me. Frankly I like to keep to myself simply to not
    be in the way, which they probably deem as an <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/introvert">Introvert</a>, as well as different types of hobbies and interests 
    to keep myself from feeling sheer boredom. I probably shouldn't name all the hobbies and interests I have cause quite honestly I have the attention span of a squirrel, but
    if I had to choose just three it would have to be 
    <ul>
        <li>Playing Games</li>
        <li>Building Computers</li>
        <li>Draw (occassionally)</li>
    </ul>
