        <strong>Terence Kelcey Priester II</strong>
        (born September 25, 1996) I'm gonna be completely honest, there's not much to
        me. Frankly I like to keep to myself simply to not be in the way, which they
        probably deem as an
        <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/introvert">Introvert</a>, as
        well as different types of hobbies and interests to keep myself from feeling
        sheer boredom. I probably shouldn't name all the hobbies and interests I have
        cause quite honestly I have the attention span of a squirrel, but if I had to
        choose just three it would have to be
        <ul>
            <li>Playing Games</li>
            <li>Building Computers</li>
            <li>Draw (occassionally)</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Drawing</h3>
            <hr size="1" noshade="0">
            Occasionally I do like to draw simple things like flowers or characters from old
            cartoons that I used to watch such as
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqVsBekxew">Invader Zim</a>
            and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Titans_(TV_series)">Teen Titans</a>
            But as time went on I started to draw less and less and have wanted to get back
            into it once more but that is proving easier said than done. Not entirely sure
            when the interest in drawing began but at some point I started looking at
            cartoon characters and wondered if I could draw them and put my own spin on
            them.I did attempt to take classes in Art in High School as well as some
            attempts at drawing but I didnt really like them so I kinda tossed them to the
            back of my closet in shame.

            <h3>Video Games</h3>
            <hr size="1" noshade="0">
            Video Games compared to my other hobbies have a special place in my heart. I've
            played games ever since I could remember starting with the Nintendo 64 days
            playing
            <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Mario 64</a>
            then moved bigger games such as
            <a href="https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a>
            (Which is probably one of my All-Time favorites). Before I start ranting on all
            the games I've experienced I've thought of my top 3 games that I can remember at
            the moment:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_Time">The Legend of Zelda (Ocarina of Time)</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a
                        href="https://splintercell.fandom.com/wiki/Tom_Clancy%27s_Splinter_Cell:_Blacklist">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0339767/">Tekken 4</a>
                </li>
            </ol>
